# Kiwi VSCode

Better support for the Kiwi message format in Visual Studio Code.

Forked from [connorskees/kiwi-lsp](https://github.com/connorskees/kiwi-lsp), which published on [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connorskees.kiwi-lsp), identified by `connorskees.kiwi-lsp`.

## Features

The following features are provided by the original plugin:

- Syntax highlighting using TextMate syntax
- Basic language configuration (comments, brackets, etc)
- Jump-to-definition, autocomplete, find-all-references, codelens support, basic docs on hover, and minor linting
- Quick actions for changing incorrect casing and generating the next available id for messages (especially useful for large messages with hundreds of fields)
